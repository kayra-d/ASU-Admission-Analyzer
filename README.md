# ASU Admission & Scholarship Analyzer

This is my first Python project developed for my portfolio at **Arizona State University (ASU)**. 

### 🚀 Purpose
The script analyzes a student's profile (GPA, SAT, and coding projects) to estimate admission chances and potential scholarship amounts at ASU.

### 🛠️ Technical Skills
* **Language:** Python
* **Concepts:** Conditional logic (if/elif/else), user input handling, and dynamic data formatting.

### 📈 Future Plans
I plan to integrate this with a live API to track current exchange rates for tuition calculations.
